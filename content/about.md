I am Evan Sharp, a nerd with opinions.

I work on [open source](https://github.com/packetmonkey), [game](https://dnd.wizards.com), and occasionally [write](/posts).
Most of the code I write is in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) or [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) within a [Neovim](https://neovim.io) buffer.
I am subscribed to around 85 [podcasts](https://overcast.fm) and over 200 [RSS feeds](https://feedbin.com).

I _may_ have a problem.
